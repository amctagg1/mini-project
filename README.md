# Mini Project

## Introduction

After downloading and installing the code, you will see a barebones application that displays information about Rick and Morty characters. Your goal is to apply the design from the Figma file you were provided with.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

## Development server

After installing npm packages, you can run `ng serve` to start a development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` and you will see the application. The app will reload automatically when you change any of the source files.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
